This repository contains a Dockerfile with an incorrect CMD instruction. The original Dockerfile attempts to run a Python application, but the CMD instruction is not properly formatted. This results in the application failing to start within the Docker container. The solution demonstrates the correct way to use the CMD instruction to run a Python application within a Docker container.
